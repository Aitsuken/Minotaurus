# Minotaurus
 Not an energy drink!
Minotaurus was supposed to be a maze-like game where you are running from minotaur and use magic candles which will flash light to distract minotaur for a while and give you extra time to find the way to the exit with restricted vision on the map.

Unfortunately the game was not ready due to difficulties with understanding of gridpane in last 3 days before submission and extreme amount of procrastination. Completed work is planned to be submitted on finals.
